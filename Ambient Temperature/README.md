# Ambient Temperature
MATLAB script designed to utilize a temperature sensor to turn on an LED if abmient is greater than a predetermined threshold.

### Materials:
- Arduino Uno
- TMP36 Temperature Sensor
- 1 LED
- 1 resistor

### Specifications:
- Read, record, and plot the temperature data.
- If the ambient temperature is greater than a predetermined threshold, turn on an LED.
- If the ambient temperature falls below the predetermined threshold, turn off the LED.
