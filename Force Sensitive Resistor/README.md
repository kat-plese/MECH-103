# Force Sensitive Resistor
MATLAB script designed to utilize a force sensor to detect distances through electrical resistance.

### Materials:
- Arduino Uno
- Force Sensitive Resistor 
- 4 LEDS
- 4 resistors

### Specifications:
- Depending on the force placed on the FSR, LED lights will turn on:

    (a) One light = 250+W_0 < force <= 500+W_0
 
    (b) Two lights =  500+W_0 < force <= 1000+W_0
  
    (c) Three lights =  1000+W_0 < force <= 2000+W_0
    
    (d) Four lights =  Force > 2000
