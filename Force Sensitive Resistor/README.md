# Force Sensitive Resistor
MATLAB script designed to utilize a force sensor to detect distances through electrical resistance.

### Materials:
- Arduino Uno
- Force Sensitive Resistor 
- 4 LEDS
- 5 resistors

### Specifications:
- If the force is between 250 and 500, one LED is lit.
- If the force is between 500 and 1000, two LEDs are lit.
- If the force is between 1000 and 2000, three LEDs are lit.
- If the force is greater than 2000, four LEDs are lit.
