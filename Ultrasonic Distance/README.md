# Ultrasonic Distance
MATLAB script designed to utilize an ultrasonic sensor to detect distances through SONAR.

### Materials:
- Arduino Uno
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor 
- Piezo Speaker
- 5 LEDS (2 Red, 1 Yellow, 2 Green)
- 5 resistors

### Specifications:
- If object is sensed further than 2 meters away, the both green LEDs are lit.
- If object is sensed between 2 and 1 meters away, only 1 green LED is lit.
- If object is sensed between 1.25 and 0.75 meter away the yellow LED is lit.
- If object is sensed between 1 and 0.75 meters away, 1 red LED is lit.
- If object is sensed between 0.75 and 0 meters away 2 red LEDs are lit.
